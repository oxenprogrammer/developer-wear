# Sudo Wear

Sudo Wear is a Rails 6 API tied to a frontend written in react, made using the methodology and indications of the Capstone Project provided by [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/). It provides endpoints to consume with an front-end client.

The documentation of this API is still under developement, I have manually documented the available endpoints below.

**Nice to Have**
I chose to implement a proper authentication since security is very important when collecting real user imformation. Users are protected by the Data Protection Policy updated in 2019

## Built With

- Ruby v3.01
- Ruby on Rails v6.1.0
